## Project Description
Our project aim to discover the scenario where neural networks are vulnerable against adversarial attack. We first generate several common neural networks, such as convolutional neural network. Then we try some existing attacks against given neural network such as black-box attack and white-box attack to fool the neural networks. Finally we came up with our own efficient adversarial attacking method that can efficiently and accurately attack a given neural networks under given conditions.
